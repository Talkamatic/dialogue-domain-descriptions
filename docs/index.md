# Getting started

Welcome to the Talkamatic documentation. The site you just entered describes:

- the foundation of our technologies, most notably the [Dialog formalism](formalism.md) that models our entire dialog universe
- some [assistance for dialog designers](for-dialog-designers), a [tutorial](for-dialog-designers/tutorial.md) and some publicly available [code examples](for-dialog-designers/examples.md) among other things
- [API definitions](api-definitions), whether you integrate the [TDM Pipeline](api-definitions/pipeline_api.md) into your software stack, build your own [NLU](api-definitions/nlu_api.md) or create your own domain-specific [service](api-definitions/service_api.md) doesn't matter, it's all there

Additionally, there's further illustrated reading about TDM wrapped into a [PDF here](https://github.com/Talkamatic/dialogue-domain-descriptions/blob/master/dialog-design.pdf).
